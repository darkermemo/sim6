## 🔧 Advanced Technical Implementation

### 🏗️ **Intelligent Threat Engine Architecture**
```rust
pub struct ThreatIntelEngine {
    malicious_ips: HashMap<String, String>,     // Known IOC database
    checks_performed: u64,                      // Performance metrics
    threats_found: u64,                         // Detection statistics
}

pub struct ThreatResult {
    has_threats: bool,                          // Binary threat indicator
    threat_score: f64,                          // Risk scoring (0.0-10.0)
    risk_level: String,                         // Human-readable risk
    summary: String,                            // Threat summary
    metadata: HashMap<String, String>,          // Enrichment data
}
```

### 🎯 **Multi-Vector Threat Detection**
1. **IP-Based IOC Matching**: Source and destination IP correlation against known threat database
2. **Content Analysis**: Message parsing for malware, exploit, phishing indicators
3. **Behavioral Scoring**: Dynamic risk calculation based on multiple threat factors
4. **Real-Time Enrichment**: Automatic metadata injection into all parsed events

### 📊 **Dynamic Risk Scoring Algorithm**
```rust
let risk_level = match threat_score {
    score if score >= 8.0 => "Critical",    // Immediate response required
    score if score >= 6.0 => "High",        // Priority investigation
    score if score >= 3.0 => "Medium",      // Standard monitoring
    score if score > 0.0 => "Low",          // Informational tracking
    _ => "None",                             // Clean traffic
};
```
