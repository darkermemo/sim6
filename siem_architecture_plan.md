# Complete SIEM Architecture Plan

Based on the awesome-siem repository and cybersader's Security Operations Data Engineering Framework (SODEF), this document outlines a comprehensive SIEM replacement architecture.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Data Pipeline Layer (Primary Focus)
- **Data Ingestion**: Replace current ingestors with unified pipeline
- **Data Transformation**: Normalize to CSV/JSON/Parquet formats
- **Data Routing**: Smart routing based on data type and priority
- **Cost Optimization**: Warehouse only what's needed for analysis

### 2. Storage Layer
- **Security Data Lake**: Central repository for all security data
- **ClickHouse**: High-performance analytics database
- **S3-compatible storage**: Cost-effective long-term retention
- **Hot/Warm/Cold tiers**: Optimize storage costs

### 3. Detection Engine
- **Sigma Rules**: Community-driven detection rules
- **Correlation Engine**: Multi-source event correlation
- **Machine Learning**: Anomaly detection and UEBA
- **Threat Intelligence**: IOC matching and enrichment

### 4. Analytics and Visualization
- **ClickVisual Rust**: Primary log analysis interface
- **Grafana Integration**: Dashboards and alerting
- **Custom Analytics**: Rust-based analysis tools

### 5. Response and Orchestration
- **SOAR Integration**: Automated response workflows
- **Case Management**: Incident tracking and management
- **Playbooks**: Standardized response procedures

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Pipeline Foundation
1. Implement unified data ingestion service
2. Create data transformation and normalization layer
3. Establish data lake with tiered storage
4. Migrate existing log sources

### Phase 2: Detection and Analytics
1. Deploy Sigma rule engine
2. Implement correlation capabilities
3. Integrate threat intelligence feeds
4. Build custom analytics dashboards

### Phase 3: Response and Automation
1. Implement SOAR workflows
2. Create incident response playbooks
3. Build case management system
4. Integrate with existing security tools

## Technology Stack

### Core Services (Rust)
- **siem_ingestor**: Unified data ingestion
- **siem_transformer**: Data normalization and enrichment
- **siem_correlator**: Event correlation engine
- **siem_analyzer**: Analytics and ML services
- **clickvisual_rust**: Primary UI and query interface

### Supporting Infrastructure
- **ClickHouse**: Primary analytics database
- **Kafka**: Event streaming and buffering
- **MinIO/S3**: Object storage for data lake
- **Redis**: Caching and session management
- **PostgreSQL**: Metadata and configuration storage

### Integration Points
- **Grafana**: Dashboards and monitoring
- **Sigma**: Community detection rules
- **MISP**: Threat intelligence platform
- **Elastic**: Optional for specific use cases

## Key Benefits

1. **Cost Effective**: Pay only for what you analyze
2. **Scalable**: Cloud-native architecture
3. **Open Source**: No vendor lock-in
4. **Customizable**: Rust-based components for performance
5. **Community Driven**: Leverage Sigma rules and threat intel

## Migration Plan

### From Current SIEM
1. **Assessment**: Catalog current data sources and use cases
2. **Parallel Deployment**: Run new system alongside existing
3. **Gradual Migration**: Move data sources incrementally
4. **Validation**: Ensure detection coverage maintained
5. **Cutover**: Complete migration and decommission old system

### Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 4-6 weeks (Data pipeline)
- **Phase 2**: 6-8 weeks (Detection and analytics)
- **Phase 3**: 4-6 weeks (Response and automation)
- **Total**: 14-20 weeks for complete replacement

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance**: Query response times < 2 seconds
2. **Cost**: 50% reduction in SIEM operational costs
3. **Coverage**: 100% detection rule migration
4. **Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA
5. **Scalability**: Handle 10x current log volume

This architecture provides a modern, cost-effective SIEM solution that leverages the best practices from the cybersecurity community while maintaining the performance benefits of your Rust infrastructure.
