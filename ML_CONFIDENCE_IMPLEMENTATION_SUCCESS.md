### 🎯 **Intelligent Confidence Adjustment**
- **Upgrade Threshold:** 0.85 ML score → promotes confidence level
- **Downgrade Threshold:** 0.4 ML score → reduces confidence level
- **Feature Weighting:** Learned weights optimize decision accuracy
- **Real-time Adaptation:** Statistics update with each parsing attempt

### 📊 **Demonstrated Intelligence Examples**
```
🔍 Low Quality Detection:
   Input: "random text with no structure"
   Base: Low → ML: VeryLow (Score: 0.326)
   Reason: "ML downgrade: low ML score or data quality issues"

🎯 High Quality Recognition:
   Input: F5 BIG-IP logs with full field extraction
   Base: VeryHigh → ML: High (Score: 0.786)
   Reason: Adaptive learning from data patterns

💡 Stable Assessment:
   Input: Structured JSON logs
   Base: Medium → ML: Medium (Score: 0.596)
   Reason: "ML confirms base confidence assessment"
```
