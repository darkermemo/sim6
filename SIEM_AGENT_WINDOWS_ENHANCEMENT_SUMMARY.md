# SIEM Agent Windows Event Log Collection Enhancement

**Implementation Date:** July 21, 2025  
**Enhancement Objective:** Add Windows Event Log Collection Capabilities  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

## Overview

This enhancement adds critical Windows Event Log collection capabilities to the SIEM agent, enabling it to collect logs directly from Windows systems like Active Directory Domain Controllers, workstations, and servers using the native Windows Eventing API. This provides comprehensive visibility into Windows security events, application logs, and system activities.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Windows-Specific Dependencies

**Added Dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:**
```toml
[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies]
windows = { version = "0.52", features = ["Win32_System_EventLog", "Win32_Foundation", "Win32_System_Com", "Win32_Security"] }
winapi = { version = "0.3", features = ["evntprov", "winevt", "winerror"] }
```

**Key Features:**
- Platform-specific compilation - only includes Windows dependencies on Windows platforms
- Uses the official `windows` crate for modern Windows API access
- Includes `winapi` for additional Windows Event Log functionality
- Conditional compilation ensures cross-platform compatibility

### 2. Enhanced Configuration Structure

**New Configuration Section:**
```yaml
# Windows Event Log monitoring configuration
windows_event_channels:
  - channel: "Security"
    type: "windows_security"
  - channel: "Application"
    type: "windows_application"
  - channel: "System"
    type: "windows_system"
  - channel: "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"
    type: "sysmon"
```

**Configuration Features:**
- Supports multiple event channels simultaneously
- Configurable log types for proper categorization
- Seamless integration with existing file monitoring
- Automatic defaults for Windows platforms

### 3. Windows Event Log Collector Module

**New Module: `src/windows_collector.rs`**

#### Core Functionality
- **Native Windows API Integration:** Direct access to Windows Event Log APIs
- **Real-time Event Streaming:** Polls event channels every 5 seconds for new events
- **XML Event Rendering:** Extracts full event XML for complete forensic data
- **Record ID Tracking:** Prevents duplicate event collection across restarts
- **Cross-platform Compatibility:** Stub implementation for non-Windows platforms

#### Key Components

**WindowsEventCollector Structure:**
```rust
pub struct WindowsEventCollector {
    buffer_db: Arc<Db>,
    local_hostname: String,
}
```

**Channel Subscription Logic:**
- Opens Windows Event Log channels using `EvtOpenLog`
- Creates XPath queries to fetch new events since last collection
- Processes events in batches for efficiency
- Handles event rendering to XML format
- Buffers events using the same mechanism as file tailing

**Event Processing:**
- Extracts complete event XML content
- Tracks event record IDs for deduplication
- Creates standardized log entries
- Integrates with existing buffering and forwarding system

### 4. Main Agent Integration

**Enhanced Startup Logic:**
- Detects Windows platform and initializes Windows collectors
- Spawns separate async tasks for each configured event channel
- Integrates with existing shutdown and error handling
- Maintains compatibility with file-based monitoring

**Parallel Operation:**
- Windows Event Log collection runs alongside file tailing
- Uses the same buffer database and forwarding mechanism
- Shares configuration and logging infrastructure
- Maintains unified agent lifecycle management

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Windows Event Logs → Event API → XML Rendering → Log Entry → Buffer → HTTP Forward → SIEM Pipeline
                                                                      ↓
File Logs → File Tailing → Log Entry → Buffer → HTTP Forward → SIEM Pipeline
```

### Event Processing Pipeline
1. **Channel Subscription:** Subscribe to Windows Event Log channels
2. **Event Polling:** Query for new events since last record ID
3. **XML Extraction:** Render events to full XML format
4. **Record Tracking:** Update last processed record ID
5. **Buffering:** Store events in embedded database
6. **Forwarding:** Send events through existing HTTP forwarding mechanism

### Cross-Platform Design
- **Windows Platform:** Full Windows Event Log collection capability
