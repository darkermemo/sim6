# 🚀 MASSIVE LOG GENERATION - STATUS UPDATE

**Generated on:** July 24, 2025 at 16:27

## 📊 Current Progress

- **Logs Generated:** 5,000,000+ logs
- **Uncompressed Size:** 4.67+ GB
- **Compressed Size:** 635 MB
- **Compression Ratio:** ~86.4% (excellent compression efficiency)
- **Progress toward 1B logs:** 0.5%
- **Progress toward 200GB:** 2.3%

## ⚡ Performance Metrics

- **Generation Rate:** ~170+ GB/hour (uncompressed)
- **Threads Active:** 20 threads
- **Tenants Simulated:** 20 different tenants
- **Log Formats:** 4 types (Trend Micro LEEF, F5 ASM, Sophos WAF, FortiGate UTM)
- **Average Log Size:** ~1KB per log

## 🎯 Target Goals

### Primary Targets:
- **1 Billion Logs** OR **200 GB** (whichever comes first)
- **Current ETA:** Based on current rate, approximately 1-2 hours to reach 200GB

### Log Distribution:
- **20 Tenants:** tenant_001 through tenant_020
- **Randomized Source IPs:** Realistic IP ranges
- **Fixed Timestamps:** Current time for all logs
- **Security Event Types:** Authentication, network, malware, policy violations
