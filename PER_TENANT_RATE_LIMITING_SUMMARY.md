# Per-Tenant Rate Limiting Implementation Summary

## Objective: Implement Per-Tenant Rate Limiting (Chunk 4.3)

### Task 1: Refactor Rate-Limiting Middleware ✅

Successfully implemented per-tenant rate limiting to fix test [A-5] by:

1. **Created Custom Key Extractor**:
   - Implemented `TenantKeyExtractor` struct that implements the `KeyExtractor` trait
   - Extracts tenant_id from JWT claims in the Authorization header
   - Falls back to IP address for unauthenticated requests

2. **Updated Governor Configuration**:
   - Changed from global rate limiting to per-tenant
   - Rate limit: 1 request per second with burst of 10
   - Applied only to POST /events endpoint (GET remains unrestricted)

3. **Code Changes in siem_api/src/main.rs**:
   ```rust
   // Custom key extractor for per-tenant rate limiting
   struct TenantKeyExtractor;
   
   impl KeyExtractor for TenantKeyExtractor {
       type Key = String;
       type KeyExtractionError = SimpleKeyExtractionError<String>;
       
       fn extract(&self, req: &ServiceRequest) -> Result<Self::Key, Self::KeyExtractionError> {
           // Extracts tenant_id from JWT or falls back to IP
       }
   }
   ```

### Task 2: Verification Results ✅

Created and executed `test_per_tenant_rate_limit.sh` which:

1. **Test 1**: Exhausted Tenant-A's rate limit
   - Sent 15 rapid requests
   - Result: 10 successful, 5 rate-limited ✅

2. **Test 2**: Verified Tenant-B not affected
   - Tenant-B could make requests while Tenant-A was rate-limited ✅
   - Proves rate limiting is per-tenant, not global

3. **Test 3**: Verified independent limits
   - Tenant-B has its own burst of 10 requests ✅
   - Got rate-limited after exhausting its own quota

### Results

**Test [A-5] Per-Tenant Rate Limiting: PASSED** ✅

The rate limiting is now correctly applied on a per-tenant basis:
- Each tenant has independent rate limits
- One tenant exceeding their limit does not affect others
- The system properly extracts tenant_id from JWT tokens
- Unauthenticated requests fall back to IP-based rate limiting

This implementation ensures fair resource usage across tenants while preventing any single tenant from overwhelming the system.
